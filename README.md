# US Accidents Analysis (2016–2023)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes **7.7M+ accident records** from the United States (2016–2023) to uncover trends, patterns, and key insights into accident severity, geography, weather conditions, and time-based distributions.  
The goal was to perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and create an **interactive dashboard in Power BI** for better decision-making and visualization.

## 🔍 Key Tasks
- Cleaned and preprocessed the dataset (handled missing values, feature engineering like hour, day, month, bins).  
- Conducted EDA in Python to explore:
  - Accident count by severity, state, city, hour, day, and month.  
  - Relationship of weather (temperature, wind speed, visibility, precipitation) with accident severity.  
  - Impact of traffic signals, junctions, and crossings on accidents.  
- Built a **multi-page Power BI dashboard** with slicers, drill-through, and interactive navigation.

## 📊 Insights
- **Medium severity accidents** were the highest (~6.1M), while **fatal accidents** were ~204K.  
- **Rush hours (7–9 AM & 4–6 PM)** showed the peak number of accidents.  
- **Fridays** had the highest accidents, while **Sundays** had the least.  
- Weather plays a strong role: low visibility and high wind speeds are linked to more severe accidents.  
- States like **California, Florida, and Texas** recorded the most accidents.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- **Python**: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn (EDA & preprocessing)  
- **SQL**: Data cleaning & extraction  
- **Power BI**: Dashboard creation (DAX, Power Query, visualizations)  
- **GitHub**: Version control & project hosting
